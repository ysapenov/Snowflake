# Snowflake

This repository showcases my experience with Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform. It contains projects, ideas, examples, and workarounds.

## Experience

I have used Snowflake in two projects, primarily as a data source for Power BI reports. This experience has given me hands-on knowledge of:

- Connecting Snowflake to Power BI
- Querying data from Snowflake
- Optimizing data retrieval for reporting purposes

## Certification

I obtained the SnowProÂ® Core Certification in 2023, demonstrating my proficiency in Snowflake technologies and best practices. To prepare for this certification, I completed a Hands-On Lab that covered various aspects of Snowflake:

- Database creation and data loading
- ELT Data Workflow implementation 
- Integration with BI tools and SQL editors
- Performance optimization with different warehouse sizes and caching techniques
- Other Snowflake features: Object Cloning, Time Travel, Data Sharing
- Snowpipe for automated incremental data loading

## Projects

While specific project details are not available due to confidentiality, here's an overview of how Snowflake was utilized:

1. Project 1: Data warehousing and integration with Power BI for business intelligence reporting.
2. Project 2: Real-time data analytics using Snowflake as the backend for Power BI dashboards.
